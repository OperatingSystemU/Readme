This is the master TODO list of which repos will get attention during what phase. If a repo has no TODO list then it can be assumed
that what needs to be done is bug fixes and optimization with things like compton
It is strongly sugested you develop with repos in the current phase but if you feel your skills can be of more
benefit in a repo on a diffrent stage then don't hesitate to contribute to that repo. See the TODO's within specific
